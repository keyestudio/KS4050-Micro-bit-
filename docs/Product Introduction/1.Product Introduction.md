## 1.5 Micro:bit Shield

### 1.5.1 Introduction

In the education market, micro:bit control boards are becoming increasingly popular. However, a single micro:bit is not easy to test with other sensor modules. So we specially design this keyestudio sensor expansion board for it.

It splits all IO ports on the micro:bit board into 3-pin interfaces (GND, VCC, Signal), making it very convenient to connect the board and other sensor modules.

In addition, it also extends some commonly used serial communication interfaces to pins or female headers with a spacing of 2.54mm, including I2C and SPI communication pins. Therefore, it enables communication between the micro:bit and other communication devices.

The micro:bit can be powered through the black DC port(DC 7-9V) or the micro USB port(DC 5V) on the expansion board.

When powering the sensor, the supply voltage can be selected as 3.3V or 5V by the jumper caps V1 and V2.

⚠️ **Attention:**

When external sensors are connected to the board, the working current of the AMS1117-3.3V and NCP1117ST50T3G chips will be very large to cause overheating. Please pay attention to avoiding contact them to prevent them from being burned out.

## 1.6 About Micro:bit

### 1.6.1 What is Micro:bit?

Micro:bit is a microcomputer development board used for programming education among teenagers, which is launched by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).

Though it is just the size of a credit card, the Micro:bit V2.0 board is equipped with loads of components,including a 5*5 LED dot matrix, 2 programmable buttons, an accelerometer, a compass, a thermometer, a touch-sensitive logo and a MEMS microphone, a Bluetooth module of low energy, and a buzzer and others. Thus, it also boasts multiple functions. The buzzer built in the other side of the board plays all kinds of sounds without any external equipment. Moreover, this board has a sleeping mode to lower power consumption of batteries when users long-press the Reset & Power button on the back.

### 1.6.4 Notes for Application

1\. It is recommended to cover it with a silicone protector to prevent short circuit for it has a lot of sophisticated electronic components.

2\. Its IO port is very weak in driving since it can merely handle current less than 300mA. Therefore, do not connect it with devices operating in large current, such as servo MG995 and DC motor or it will get burnt. Furthermore, you must figure out the current requirements of the devices before you use them and it is generally recommended to use the board together with a Micro:bit shield.

3\. It is recommended to power the main board via the USB interface or via the battery of 3V. The IO port of this board is 3V3, so it does not support sensors of 5V. If you need to connect sensors of 5V, a micro:bit shield is required.

4\. When using pins(P3, P4, P6, P7 and P10) shared with the LED dot matrix, blocking them from the matrix or the LEDs may display randomly and the data about sensors connected maybe wrong.

5\. **Pin 19 and 20 can not be used as IO ports** though the Makecode shows they can. They can only be used as I2C communication.

6\. The battery port of 3V cannot be connected with battery more than 3.3V or the main board will be damaged.

7\. Forbid to operate it on metal products to avoid short circuit.

To put it simple, micro:bit board is like a microcomputer which has made programming at our fingertips and enhanced digital innovation.
